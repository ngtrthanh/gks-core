# Changelog

All notable changes to gks-core. Dates are UTC.

## 2026-07-10 — Agent-0 FINAL CONSTITUTIONAL VERDICT: Phase 1 accepted

- **Phase 1 (Kernel Validation) is ACCEPTED.** Agent-0's final verdict closes the
  *implementation* program: "The remaining work is no longer implementation work.
  It is scientific confirmation." Recorded in `AGENT-0-DECISIONS.md`.
- No code change — a status ruling. `PROGRESS.md` updated: Phase 1 → ✅ Accepted;
  one-line status and §4 reframed — what remains (independent replication for
  D0 §9.2 convergence, and the C1 minimality question) is **scientific
  confirmation**, not engineering. The falsification campaign stands open; no
  criterion has triggered.
- Marks **v1.0.0**: the accepted reference realization of ⟨B, T⟩ — six
  constructors, invariants I1–I9 (tested/CI-proved), all D1.5 obligations T1–T8
  Lean-mechanized, Ê layer, CNF+seal, temporal reads, validation + continuous
  ingestion.

## 2026-07-10 — T4/T5/T7 mechanized: all eight obligations T1–T8 CI-compiled

- **Milestone: every D1.5 theorem obligation (T1–T8) is now machine-checked.**
  - `mechanization/Governance/Algebra/Stability.lean` (new):
    - `eval_rename_stable` — **T4 / I4** registry rename-stability (induction on
      `Expr`; token identities are inert under a left-invertible renaming);
    - `verdict_erases_presentation` — **T5 / I5** presentation erasure (`rfl`; the
      verdict is a function of the term alone).
  - `mechanization/Governance/Kernel/Invariants.lean`: `tix_total_preserved` —
    **T7 / I6** bitemporal totality (append-only extension with a valid index
    preserves store-wide index totality).
- **CI-verified:** GitHub Actions `lean.yml` green on Lean 4.31.0 (build + zero
  `sorry`) — T4/T5/T7 compiled first try. Now CI-compiled: **T1, T2, T3, T4, T5,
  T6, T7, T8** + D1.2 uniqueness-of-sorts. Every invariant with a Go test also has
  a machine-checked proof.
- `spec/D1.5` ledger T4/T5/T7 → **proved**; PROGRESS Phase 2 → 🟢 all theorem
  obligations done, §8.3 🟢 Met, invariant scorecard I4/I5/I6 → tested+proved;
  README updated. **Sole remaining D1.5 item: C1 (minimality) conjecture.**

## 2026-07-09 — T1 (decidability + termination) discharged in Lean (CI-compiled)

- **Milestone: D1.5 §T1 proved for the mechanized `Expr` fragment.** New
  `mechanization/Governance/Algebra/Typing.lean`:
  - `infer` — a **total** structural sort-inference function over `Expr`;
  - `typing_decidable : Decidable (∃ t, HasType Γ e t)` — the typing leg of T1
    (static analyzability is decidable);
  - `typing_unique` — the D1.2 **Uniqueness of Sorts** metatheorem.
  - `Semantics.lean` adds `eval_terminates : ∃ v, eval ρ e = v` — the termination
    leg (evaluation is total; the sub-Turing algebra never diverges).
- **CI-verified:** GitHub Actions `lean.yml` green on Lean 4.31.0 (build + zero
  `sorry`). Now CI-compiled: **T1, T2, T3, T6, T8** + uniqueness-of-sorts.
- `spec/D1.5` T1 → **proved (scoped)**; PROGRESS Phase 2 / 8.3, README updated.
  Scope: the mechanized `Expr` (9 core productions; `Count`/`Window` extension
  and C1 minimality remain).

## 2026-07-09 — Continuous-ingestion control plane (8.4)

- **Milestone: one-shot ingestion → a repeatable, idempotent, ledgered pipeline.**
  - `db/migrations/0006_ingestion_ledger.sql` + `schema.sql`: append-only
    `ingestion_run` ledger (corpus, source_digest, instances before/after,
    outcome, ran_at); `e_writer` INSERT/SELECT. Applied to the live DB.
  - `cmd/ingest_run`: manifest-driven (`data/corpora.json`) control plane that
    classifies each corpus by SHA-256 vs the latest ledger entry as
    NEW / CHANGED / UP-TO-DATE. `--reconcile` records the current digest as the
    baseline without ingesting; `--apply` ingests NEW/CHANGED only and **skips
    UP-TO-DATE** (safe no-op). Dry-run by default. Prints the Registry Law status.
  - Idempotency lives in the control plane by design: `kernel_instance`'s
    `no_overlapping_text_validity` EXCLUDE constraint rejects overlapping
    re-inserts, so re-invoking an ingester on an unchanged corpus is neither safe
    nor needed — the ledger makes a scheduled re-run a no-op.
  - `make ingest` (dry-run) / `make ingest-apply`.
- **Verified:** dry-run→NEW, `--reconcile`→baseline, dry-run→UP-TO-DATE,
  `--apply`→idempotent skip (0-delta, exit 0), Registry Law HELD (basis=6)
  throughout; ledger audit trail present. `go build/vet/test ./...` green.
- `PROGRESS.md` 8.4 → 🟢 Substantial.

## 2026-07-09 — Agent-0 constitutional rulings implemented

Three pending constitutional decisions (see `AGENT-0-DECISIONS.md`) were ruled by
Agent-0 and implemented in full; all `AGENT-0-DECISION-*` markers removed.

- **Ruling 1 — TIX (Option A).** TIX is the bitemporal **index** carried by every
  instance, *not* a constructor; the basis is the six governance constructors
  `{NRM,CLS,PWR,GRD,REF,VAL}`. D1.1 Def 3.1 → 6 (+ τ metadata clarification);
  D1.2 `WF-TIX` reframed as the index-metadata judgment `WF-τ`; README I3 + spec
  index → 6; unused `TIXPayload` removed. No DB change (migration 0002 already
  six-valued).
- **Ruling 2 — NRM Force (Option B).** The kernel recognizes only *obligations*;
  permission = absence of NRM, prohibition = GRD. `NRMPayload.Force` marked
  **deprecated** (legacy read only); D1.1 NRM relation drops the `×Force`
  component; D1.2 drops the Force operand from `WF-NRM` and deprecates the
  `Force` sort; Axiom 1.2 annotated. Machine transition logic unchanged.
- **Ruling 3 — Verdict (Option B).** `DEFEATED` is now a **first-class verdict**,
  distinct from `INAPPLICABLE` (preserving provenance). `e_verdict` enum gains
  `defeated` (migration `0005_verdict_defeated.sql` + `schema.sql`, applied to the
  live DB); the resolver's `DEFEATED` state maps to the `defeated` verdict (was
  `inapplicable`); `machine_test` distinguishes the two.
- `go build/vet/test ./...` green; `make spec` OK.

## 2026-07-09 — Lean proofs compile in CI; T8 (I7) discharged (Phase 2 tractable set)

- **Milestone: the Lean mechanization is machine-verified.** New
  `.github/workflows/lean.yml` installs elan on a GitHub runner (which reaches
  the Lean toolchain that is blocked in the dev env) and runs `lake build` +
  a guard asserting **zero `sorry`**. Green on Lean **4.31.0**.
- **T8 (I7) discharged.** `strata_wellFounded` proved via the Lean-core instance
  `Nat.lt_wfRel.wf` (no mathlib) — was `sorry`.
- Now **CI-compiled**: T2 (I1, `eval_is_pure`), T3 (I8, `eval_deterministic`),
  T6 (I2, `append_only_monotone`), T8 (I7, `strata_wellFounded`).
- Fixed a latent error surfaced by the first real compile: `Semantics.lean` had
  its `import` after the module docstring (Lean requires imports first).
- `spec/D1.5` ledger: T2/T3/T6/T8 → **proved (CI-compiled)**; README + PROGRESS
  updated — Phase 2's tractable set is done; 8.3 Formal Mechanization → 🟢. The
  earlier "Lean toolchain blocked" gate is resolved (bypassed via GitHub runners).
  Open Phase-2 items are now the research conjectures T1 (decidability) and
  C1 (minimality).

## 2026-07-09 — Milestone loop complete; sole remaining gate = Lean toolchain

- **Verifiable-here roadmap set is exhausted.** Every invariant I1–I9 now has a
  passing test or a written proof; Tracks A–D, the store-wide screen, the
  multi-domain Registry Law, I5-erasure and I7-well-foundedness all land and the
  full suite is green (`go build/vet/test ./...`, 9-test invariant suite PASS).
- **Governance:** `AGENT-0-DECISIONS.md` files the three open constitutional
  rulings (TIX enum/G6, NRM Force O|P|F/G5, resolver→verdict/G3) as a formal
  request — options + advisory recommendations, not self-resolved.
- **Doc hygiene:** PROGRESS 8.3 now distinguishes Go-*tested* invariants (I5/I7)
  from Lean-*proved* ones.
- **Sole remaining engineering gate:** the Lean toolchain is unreachable in this
  environment (elan DNS + GitHub release assets), blocking CI-compilation of the
  I1/I2/I8 proofs and discharge of T8 (I7). Unblocks in any GitHub-asset-reachable
  CI. Nothing else verifiable here remains open.

## 2026-07-09 — Registry Law verified across heterogeneous domains

- **Milestone (`internal/invariants/registry_law_test.go`).**
  `TestRegistryLawBoundedBasisAcrossDomains` proves the Θ(1) Registry Law over the
  **4 real normative domains** already in the store — VN labour statute, ISO 9001,
  US tax §121, KPI/policy (6 locus-domains incl. fixtures): every domain's
  constructor set ⊆ B, and the union across all domains is exactly
  `{CLS,GRD,NRM,PWR,REF,VAL}` (|B|=6). Adding domains adds no constructor.
- `PROGRESS.md` 8.4 upgraded (multi-domain demonstrated; residual gap is
  *automated/continuous* ingestion). `go build/vet/test ./...` green.

## 2026-07-09 — Track D: clause-level extraction-depth study

- **Milestone (`cmd/trackd`, `validation/trackd/REPORT.md`).** Reads stored docx
  source text only (no re-ingestion), segments each unit into khoản/điểm clauses,
  and runs two independent classifiers at paragraph vs clause granularity.
  - **Finding 1:** the corpus is already *clause-atomic* — every stored unit begins
    with its own khoản/điểm marker, so segmentation recovers **0** further units
    (×1.00) and **0** unit is multi-modal. Extraction depth is already maximal.
  - **Finding 2:** two fresh independent classifiers agree at **κ=0.8380** on the
    same units — above the Track B stored-vs-independent baseline (0.7877). The
    Track B gap traced largely to the older ingester rules frozen in the store,
    not to genuine textual ambiguity.
  - **Finding 3:** the improvement lever is *semantic cue modelling*, not finer
    segmentation.
- `PROGRESS.md` updated (8.4 Continuous Ingestion; risks/next-steps). `go build/
  vet/test ./...` green.

## 2026-07-09 — I7 operationally verified + store-wide falsification-clean

- **Milestone: the whole live store is proven inside the frozen kernel, and I7's
  operational content is mechanically checked** (Lean T8 is still `sorry`, but its
  concrete meaning is now tested). New `internal/invariants/i7_wellfounded_test.go`:
  - `TestI7ReflectionWellFounded` — the stored REF reflection graph is **acyclic**
    (no instance transitively references itself; 3 edges, 0 cyclic nodes), so the
    reflection strata are well-founded (I7 / D1.5 T8).
  - `TestStoreWideFalsificationClean` — replays the falsification screen (the gate
    `cmd/falsify` applies to candidates) over **all 410 stored instances**: every
    constructor is in the closed basis B (I3) and every T AST (392) is within the
    sub-Turing algebra T (I1/I7). Zero FALSIFICATION-CANDIDATEs.
- `PROGRESS.md`: I7 🟡→"proof pending, empirically held"; I3 evidence extended to
  the store-wide screen.
- `go build/vet/test ./...` green.

## 2026-07-09 — I5 presentation erasure now mechanically tested

- **Milestone: the invariant scorecard has no untested invariant.** New
  `internal/invariants/i5_erasure_test.go`:
  - `TestI5PresentationErasurePure` — a fixed AST wrapped in a full presentation
    envelope, a bare `{kind,ast}` envelope, and an adversarially-mutated envelope
    all yield the same Verdict Identifier `cnf.CanonicalHash(ast)`.
  - `TestI5PresentationErasureCorpus` — proves I5 over the **live docx corpus**:
    erasing and mutating the presentation envelope (`article/chapter/cue/modality/
    temporal/text` + `source_map` locus) leaves the verdict unchanged for **all
    392 stored instances** (non-vacuous: all 392 carried erasable presentation).
- `PROGRESS.md` scorecard updated: I5 🔴→🟢; remaining weak links are I7 (`sorry`)
  and CI-compilation of the I1/I2/I8 Lean proofs.
- `go build/vet/test ./...` green.

## 2026-07-07 — Tracks A/B/C (post-handoff2; see handoff3.md)

- **Track A — mechanized semantics (Phase 2).** Mathlib-free Lean proofs in
  `mechanization/`: **T2** (I1 purity, `eval_is_pure := rfl`), **T3** (I8
  determinism, `eval_deterministic`), **T6** (I2 append-only monotonicity,
  `append_only_monotone`). **T8** (I7 well-foundedness) stated with `sorry`;
  T1/C1 remain conjectures (not faked). `make verify` now runs `lake build`
  where a Lean toolchain is present, else prints status. `spec/D1.5` ledger
  updated. NOTE: proofs are **not yet compiled in CI** — the Lean toolchain
  download is blocked in the current environment (elan host DNS fail, GitHub
  release assets unreachable); they are review-/CI-ready.
- **Track B — real inter-compiler agreement** (`cmd/interop`). An independent
  second constructor classifier (different cue set/precedence) re-classifies the
  live labour-code corpus; Fleiss' κ over **392** real loci = **0.7877**
  (≥ 0.70, floor met), 59 disagreements. Report + both CNF exports under
  `validation/interop/`. Caveat: one team maintains both classifiers → measures
  rule-robustness, not organizational independence.
- **Track C — falsification campaign** (`cmd/falsify`, `validation/falsification/`).
  Screens a held-out/adversarial input set: 5 benign units admitted (5
  constructors), 3 adversarial units (∀-unbounded, 8th constructor, fixpoint)
  **halted** with FALSIFICATION-CANDIDATE. Registry Law (basis ≤ 6, Θ(1))
  **HELD**; kernel not extended (I3).
- Track D (clause-level / multi-modality docx extraction) is the next step,
  now with a κ baseline (0.7877) to improve against.

## 2026-07-06 — WP-4, WP-6, WP-8 (handoff2)

- **WP-4 temporal read discipline (I6/G4).** New `internal/coord` parses
  `--at-text`/`--at-fact` (RFC3339, default now); every reading command
  (`verify_db`, `cnf_export`, `replay_d8`, `simulate_case`, `simulate_iso`)
  threads the coordinates into `kernel_instance_at($1,$2)` / `Engine.TText/TFact`.
  New `internal/refgraph.Impact` (recursive CTE over REF instances, temporally
  filtered) and `cmd/impact <target_iri>`; `ingest_kpi` now seeds the REF edge
  v4→P-11. DB-backed `refgraph` test proves the impacted set is
  coordinate-sensitive.
- **WP-6 registry snapshot + I4 (registry inertness).** `internal/registry`
  (`Snapshot`/`SnapshotAt`, promoted from `ingest_kpi.loadRegistry`) loads the
  versioned registry into exact Values; `Engine` gained a `Registry` field and
  every evaluating command loads a snapshot at eval start. `RenameTokens`/
  `RenameLookups` + a pure `TestI4RenameStability`: a bijective token rename
  leaves the verdict suite identical.
- **WP-8 validation harness (D0 §8.2).** `internal/validation`: Fleiss' κ over
  per-locus constructor assignment (open-texture loci excluded), verdict
  agreement over a shared suite, and the `FALSIFICATION-CANDIDATE` screen
  (constructor ∉ B or operator ∉ T ⇒ halt, kernel untouched). `cmd/validate`
  asserts the constitutional floors κ ≥ 0.70, VA ≥ 0.90; `make validate` runs
  it (testdata: κ=0.8425, VA=0.9000, halt demonstrated).
- **WP-8 corpus-derived coordinates (I8).** Ingesters no longer stamp
  `time.Now()`: `ingest_benchmark` uses the §121 statutory epoch, `ingest_iso`
  the ISO 9001:2015 date, `ingest_kpi` a declared policy epoch, and
  `ingest_docx` parses the promulgated "có hiệu lực" effective date (fixed
  fallback) — so CNF exports are reproducible across compilers.
- **Makefile:** `make validate` wired; `impact` available. CNF export remains
  byte-stable across runs on the same DB state (verified).

## 2026-07-06 — WP-7

- **Exact-rational VAL** (no float64 in verdict paths, I8): the evaluator gains
  a `KRat` value kind (`math/big.Rat`), a rational literal (`Lit.Rat`,
  `kernel.LitRat`) and an exact-division `OpRatio` (`kernel.Ratio`). Comparison
  and arithmetic promote to exact rationals when either operand is rational.
- `VALPayload` is now AST-driven — `Measure`/`Target` T-expressions and a
  comparator, evaluated via `VALPayload.AsExpr()`; the old `Target float64`
  field is gone.
- **`cmd/ingest_kpi`** persists D8 Run 6 (KPI-SEC-03): registry threshold
  `policy-p11-§4.threshold = 1` (append-only versioned, I4), v4 (VAL) and n7
  (NRM). It reads the registry back and evaluates the target
  `0.95 × reg(threshold)` exactly: 96/100 = 24/25 ≥ 19/20 → COMPLIANT,
  94/100 = 47/50 < 19/20 → VIOLATED. The 0.945-vs-0.95 boundary (where a
  float64 pipeline silently flips) is covered by unit tests.

## 2026-07-06 — WP-3

- **Ê execution layer persisted** (migration `0004_e_layer.sql`): `world_event`
  (append-only trace), `e_machine` (θ over the frozen six-state alphabet),
  `transition_log` (append-only journal; `pwr_instance` records the authorizing
  power on every K̂-affecting write — the I2↔Ê wiring), `verdict` (each row
  carries its `eval_t_text`/`eval_t_fact` coordinates, I6). θ changes only
  through `transition_log`, enforced by triggers (checked: direct UPDATE/DELETE
  of any journal table is rejected).
- **`internal/machine`**: replays the event trace through the D1.4 rules
  S-Activate / S-Defeat / S-Violate / S-Exercise. S-Exercise is the sole
  K̂-extending path (operand GRD appended with a deterministic id + source_map).
  Pure over ⟨event payloads, coordinates⟩; events replayed in
  (occurred_at, event_id) order, domains sorted (I8). Resolver→verdict mapping
  flagged `AGENT-0-DECISION-3`; no branching on the O|P|F trichotomy beyond
  S-Violate (`AGENT-0-DECISION-2`).
- **`cmd/replay_d8`** (`make replay-d8`): D8 Run 1 replays from `world_event`
  to a persisted `compliant` verdict; Run 2's concession-record PWR exercise
  appends the operand GRD, suspends n2a with `pwr_instance` set, and leaves
  n2b `conditional` on OT-1 — all persisted end-to-end.
- Invariant suite extended: I2 Ê-journal immutability. Unit tests for the
  machine cover both runs, S-Violate, replay idempotency and order-independence.

## 2026-07-06 — WP-2

- **ingesters populate `source_map` (I9 totality):** all three ingest
  commands insert one source-map row per kernel row in the same transaction
  (D8 §6 loci for Runs 1–2; `⟦corpus : Điều N ¶i : article|clause⟧` for docx).
  Each gains a `-backfill-sourcemap` mode that maps previously-ingested
  instances (docx rows matched by re-running the deterministic extraction
  walk); the live store's 404 rows are fully mapped.
- **invariant test suite started** (`internal/invariants`, skips without a
  DB): I2 UPDATE/DELETE rejected, I9 injectivity, I9 totality.
- CNF export re-sealed: records now carry real loci in their content key.

## 2026-07-06

- **Repository put under git**; baseline commit of the Phase 3.5 tree.
  `export/` (Ed25519 key material, CNF dumps) is gitignored.
- **evaluator:** open-texture boundary tokens now signal via typed
  `*BoundaryError` (`evaluator.IsBoundary`) instead of an untyped error, so
  callers can distinguish "conditional verdict required" from a genuine
  failure. `simulate_iso` asserts the typed signal.
- **evaluator (I8):** `Resolve` tie-breaks equal-priority guards by guard ID;
  verdicts no longer depend on DB row order. First tests for the semantic
  core (evaluator, resolver).
- **db (I9):** migration `0003_i9_bijection.sql` — `UNIQUE(source_map.instance_pk)`
  (injectivity enforced declaratively; totality remains a harness assertion).
  Baseline `schema.sql` synced. Note: `source_map` is still unpopulated —
  ingester backfill (WP-2) is open.
- **cnf (WP-5, I8):** exports α-rename store UUIDs to sequential ids in
  content order (constructor, locus, identity-masked payload shape, t_text,
  t_fact); payload-embedded references rewritten through the same map;
  content-key collisions warned. Byte-identical digest across runs verified
  on the live store. Pure-function tests for identity/order-independence.
- **docs:** README, `handoff.md` errata header, `docker-compose.yml` comment,
  and `validation/README.md` reconciled with the actual tree (`engine/` →
  `compiler/`; statuses now reflect what is implemented vs. open).

## Earlier (pre-git, summarized)

- Phase 3.5 hardening (migration 0002): TIX dropped from the constructor
  enum (columnar bitemporality), I2 append-only trigger, `source_map`,
  `kernel_instance_at()`, `e_writer` RBAC.
- Phase 3.1: Python MVP compiler dropped; Go + PostgreSQL only.
- Phase 1: D1.1–D1.5 formal specifications; Lean 4 scaffold.
